    "## Talking Points Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Explanation**:\n",
    "   - The presentation effectively explains the Logistic Regression model, emphasizing its use for binary classification problems.\n",
    "   - The sigmoid function is highlighted as the core mathematical component that maps predictions to probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code Structure**:\n",
    "   - The code is modular, with clear separation of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.\n",
    "   - This structure enhances readability and makes it easier to debug or extend the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "   - The use of Log-Loss as the evaluation metric is appropriate for probabilistic models, ensuring that the predicted probabilities are well-calibrated.\n",
    "   - Visualizations of the Log-Loss over iterations provide insights into the model's convergence during training."
